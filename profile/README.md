ExamEvaluator is a (work-in-progress) web application, utilizing different LLMs (Large Language Models) **to evaluate, fix and improve tests** before handing out to students.

This app also has an OCR (Optical Character Recognition) app built-in, allowing users to upload exam documents as photo files (`.png`, `.jpg`, etc.)

Supported language: **English** and **Vietnamese**

The project is aimed towards teachers, educators, and anyone who need to design tests frequently.

*Created as a submission for LHP Science & Engineering Fair.*
